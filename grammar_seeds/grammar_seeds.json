    "guidance": "When considering negation, you must look at these different types :\n\n-    Negation of existence (Example: There is no dog.)\n\n-       Negation of localisation (Example: The dog is not there/in the house.)\n\n-       Negation of inclusion in a category (Example: This is not a dog.)\n\n-       Negation of identification with a specific entity (Example: This is not my dog.)\n\n-       Negation of a quality (Example: This is not small.)\n\n-       Negation of a process (Example: The dog is not running)\n\n When a sentence implies possession, wonder if there is one or two different structures depending on the negation scope. Is the scope on the existence (Examples: I have no dog = There is no dog in relation to me), or on the possessive relation (Example: This dog is not mine = This dog is not in relation to me).\n\nIf the negative words and the structure of the sentences are different depending on those types of negation, explicitly expose those formal differences. \n\n \n\nIn all cases, you should consider the ways aspectual nuances are expressed (Examples:  There are no birds vs. There are no more birds  vs. There are no birds yet).\n\n You should also consider the differences of structure if it is an affirmation or an order."
