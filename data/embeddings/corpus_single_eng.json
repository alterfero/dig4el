    "And also, my belly hurts.",
    "It\u2019s painful.",
    "Does it hurt during the day? or only at night?",
    "Mostly at night.",
    "I don't know why.",
    "Doctor, I\u2019m a bit worried.",
    "what is going on?",
    "Have you eaten something particular lately?",
    "Hm, let me remember\u2026",
    "No, I don\u2019t think so.",

    "They were sweet.",
    "I ate many of them.",
    "I became sick after that.",
    "I see.",
    "It must have been these fruits that made you sick.",
    "If you hadn\u2019t eaten so much, you wouldn\u2019t have gotten sick.",
    "Oh Doctor, you\u2019re right.",
    "I shouldn\u2019t have.",
    "What should I do now?",
    "Don\u2019t worry.",
    "I\u2019ll give you some medicine to drink.",
    "Take it twice a day.",
    "In the morning, and in the evening.",
    "Alright Doctor.",
    "And then I\u2019ll be better?",
    "Yes",
    "you should get better soon.",
    "This is efficient medicine against fever and belly-ache.",
    "Also, you must get some rest.",
    "Don\u2019t go to work",
    "You need to sleep.",
    "Alright Doctor",
    "I understand.",
    "Thank you so much!",
    "Brother, have you seen my notebook?",
    "I\u2019ve been looking for it everywhere, but I can\u2019t find it!",
    "I don\u2019t know, sister.",
    "Which notebook?",
    "It\u2019s my math book.",
    "It\u2019s a thick, blue one.",
    "You\u2019ve seen it already.",
    "I was doing my homework on it last night in the dining room.",
    "Well, you probably left it there, then!",
    "No.",
    "I put it away in my schoolbag before I went to sleep.",
    "I think.",
    "Hm, did you look in your room, beside your bed?",
    "Yes I did.",
    " It\u2019s not there.",
    "Or perhaps on Dad\u2019s desk?",
    "Maybe it\u2019s hidden under another book?",
    "Wait... no.",
    "I can't find it.",
    "Let me look in the kitchen...",
    "Hm, not here.",
    "But I need it for my math class today!",
    "The teacher will be quite angry if I don\u2019t have my notebook.",
    "He will think I didn\u2019t do my homework.",
    "Uh oh\u2026 I think I found it!",
    "Really?!",
    "Where?",
    "Look at our little brother out there in the garden.",
    "What is he holding in his hands?",
    "Isn\u2019t it your notebook?",
    "Oh my god, yes it is",
    "But he has shredded it into pieces!",
    "It looks like he\u2019s been playing with it all morning.",
    "Oh dear, what happened to my homework?!",
    "Now I need to buy a new notebook",
    "and I need to start my work all over again.",
    "poor me, what a disaster!"
