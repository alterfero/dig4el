{"introduction":{"title":"General Introduction","description":"This lesson introduces key grammatical features of the target language for adult beginners. You will learn about the basic word order in sentences, how personal pronouns are used, ways to express possession, and how polarity (affirmation and negation) is conveyed. The examples are drawn from everyday conversations, providing a practical context for understanding these structures. The language does not mark gender in personal pronouns, but it does distinguish between inclusive and exclusive forms in the first person plural. The typical word order in sentences and noun phrases, as well as the placement of adjectives, numerals, and demonstratives, is also illustrated. This overview will help you recognize and use these patterns as you build your foundational skills."},"chapters":[{"title":"Word Order","explanation":"The target language primarily uses Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) word order in sentences, though Subject-Verb (SV) order is also observed, especially in intransitive clauses. Noun phrases typically follow a Noun-Adjective and Noun-Demonstrative order. Prepositions come before noun phrases. The examples below show how verbs often come first, followed by the subject and then the object or other elements.","examples":[{"english":"Have you ever seen pictures of my family?","target":"kā kite a'ena koe tī ta'i 'anga hoho'a o tōku ngutuā'are","gloss":" kā kite<concept:seeing>(Internal_Particularization:EVENT TENSE=GENERIC PAST) a'ena koe<concept:Ref_addressee>(Relational_Particularization:AGENT of seeing) tī ta'i 'anga hoho'a<concept:picture>(Relational_Particularization:PATIENT of seeing) o tōku<concept:Ref_speaker>(Relational_Particularization:POSSESSOR of family) ngutuā'are<concept:family>(Relational_Particularization:OBLIQUE ROLE ORIGIN of picture)"},{"english":"There is a fish!","target":"e ika","gloss":" e<concept:existing> ika<concept:fish>(Internal_Particularization:DEFINITENESS=INDEFINITE|Relational_Particularization:AGENT of existing)"},{"english":"You’ve seen it already.","target":"i kite 'ēna koe tō puta ra","gloss":" i kite<concept:seeing> 'ēna<concept:already>(Relational_Particularization:TIME INFORMATION of seeing) koe<concept:Ref_addressee>(Relational_Particularization:AGENT of seeing) tō+puta+ra<concept:Ref_1_object>(Relational_Particularization:PATIENT of seeing)"}]},{"title":"Personal Pronouns","explanation":"Personal pronouns in the target language do not distinguish gender, but there is a clear inclusive/exclusive distinction in the first person plural forms. Pronouns are used for all persons and numbers, and appear in various syntactic roles. Examples below show pronouns as agents, possessors, and patients.","examples":[{"english":"We just need food for our family.","target":"e kai nā mātou, nō te ngutuā'are","gloss":" e kai<concept:food>(Relational_Particularization:PATIENT of needing) nā mātou<concept:Ref_speaker_plus_person_excluding_addressee>(Relational_Particularization:AGENT of needing+POSSESSOR of family) nō te ngutuā'are<concept:family>(Relational_Particularization:OBLIQUE ROLE OBJECTIVE of needing)"},{"english":"You’ve never met him.","target":"kī'ere noti koe i mātau iāna","gloss":" kī'ere noti koe<concept:Ref_addressee>(Relational_Particularization:AGENT of meeting) i mātau<concept:meeting> iāna<concept:Ref_1_person>(Relational_Particularization:PATIENT of meeting)"},{"english":"Tonight we will all eat together.","target":"tātou pauroa 'ia kai tō pō nei","gloss":" tātou<concept:Ref_speaker_plus_many_including_addressee>(Relational_Particularization:AGENT of eating) pauroa<concept:together>(Relational_Particularization:QUALIFIER of eating) 'ia kai<concept:eating>(Internal_Particularization:EVENT TENSE=GENERIC FUTURE) tō+pō+nei<concept:tonight>(Relational_Particularization:TIME INFORMATION of eating)"}]},{"title":"Possession","explanation":"Possession is typically expressed by placing the possessor after the possessed noun, forming a Noun-Genitive structure. This is seen both with pronouns and with full noun phrases. The possessor may be marked with a possessive form or particle. The following examples illustrate how possession is shown in the language.","examples":[{"english":"Have you ever seen pictures of my family?","target":"kā kite a'ena koe tī ta'i 'anga hoho'a o tōku ngutuā'are","gloss":" kā kite<concept:seeing>(Internal_Particularization:EVENT TENSE=GENERIC PAST) a'ena koe<concept:Ref_addressee>(Relational_Particularization:AGENT of seeing) tī ta'i 'anga hoho'a<concept:picture>(Relational_Particularization:PATIENT of seeing) o tōku<concept:Ref_speaker>(Relational_Particularization:POSSESSOR of family) ngutuā'are<concept:family>(Relational_Particularization:OBLIQUE ROLE ORIGIN of picture)"},{"english":"This is my mother","target":"tōku ïa karakua pē'ā terā ra","gloss":" tōku<concept:Ref_speaker>(Relational_Particularization:POSSESSOR of mother) ïa karakua+pē'ā<concept:mother>(Relational_Particularization:PATIENT of equating) terā+ra<concept:POINTED_BY_SPEAKER>(Relational_Particularization:AGENT of equating)"},{"english":"Isn’t it your notebook?","target":"'ē'ere tā koe puta terā ra","gloss":" 'ē'ere tā koe<concept:Ref_addressee>(Relational_Particularization:POSSESSOR of notebook) puta<concept:notebook>(Relational_Particularization:PATIENT of equating) terā<concept:Ref_1_object>(Relational_Particularization:AGENT of equating) ra"}]},{"title":"Expression of Polarity","explanation":"Polarity, or the expression of affirmation and negation, is conveyed with specific negative markers such as 'kāre', 'kī'ere', or 'aita'. These can appear before verbs or in other positions to negate actions or states. Affirmation may be marked with words like 'ē'. The examples below illustrate how negation is formed.","examples":[{"english":"No, there’s no celebration.","target":"'aita, kāre e 'ōro'a","gloss":" 'aita kāre e 'ōro'a<concept:celebration>(Internal_Particularization:POLARITY=NEGATIVE)"},{"english":"I can't see it anymore.","target":"kāre vou e kite 'aka'ou na","gloss":" kāre vou<concept:Ref_speaker>(Relational_Particularization:AGENT of being able to) e kite<concept:seeing>(Relational_Particularization:COMPLEMENT of being able to) 'aka'ou<concept:anymore>(Relational_Particularization:TIME INFORMATION of being able to) na"},{"english":"No, I don’t cough.","target":"'aitā, kāre vou e hota","gloss":" 'aitā kāre vou<concept:Ref_speaker>(Relational_Particularization:AGENT of coughing) e hota"}]}]}
