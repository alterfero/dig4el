{"title": "How Iaai says “not”: the preverbal negator caa", "introduction": "What is negation? It’s how we say that something doesn’t happen, isn’t true, or should not be done. In English, we usually use words like not, don’t/doesn’t, didn’t, can’t, never, or no: “I don’t know,” “They can’t come,” “Never do that.” In English, not typically comes after a helper word (do, can, is) and before the main verb: “do not go,” “is not ready.” In Iaai, the documents show a simple core idea: the negative marker caa goes right before the verb. Example from the documents: e caa ûcû but “it is no longer possible.” You’ll see the same thing in many sentences below.", "sections": [{"focus": "Core pattern: caa stands right before the verb to say “not”", "example": [{"target_sentence": "Haba Ciau me ame caa löng hwan.", "source_sentence": "But Ciau did not listen to him.", "description": "The negative word caa is put immediately before the verb (here, “listen”) to make the sentence negative."}, {"target_sentence": "Bongon ûlabaidru hon veto ka han me walak me ödrumwe caa ûhnyimëködru köu,", "source_sentence": "When they were on that rock, to eat or to play, they were not face to face.", "description": "caa appears right before the verb-like part to say “were not … face to face.”"}, {"target_sentence": "ke caa xanöödra hminya he ka ânyâ ke ûnyi köödru anyin a haba jee thaan Iaai me adreme outöö Draume me oogaanâ.", "source_sentence": "but they could not undertake anything against them because they feared Draume and respected him.", "description": "caa comes directly before the part that carries the action/ability (“could …”), giving “could not.”"}, {"target_sentence": "Aa laba ga haa me öhmwa caa löng hwâm a u moomo.", "source_sentence": "He kept saying that one should not listen to you because you are a woman.", "description": "Again, caa stands right before the verb of “listen,” making it negative (“should not listen”)."}, {"target_sentence": "-Ebë! ame caa musi ötin omoomo, umwe löng?", "source_sentence": "- No!

In Iaai, the negator sits right in front of the verb."}, {"focus": "Questions and “never”: the same caa pattern", "example": [{"target_sentence": "Ödrumwe caa hnyi hlingâ lakei Draume me Ihili ka thâân me an a walee latuhödru me anyidru jee lap.", "source_sentence": "They never killed the subjects of Draume and of Ihili to put them in the oven and eat them, because they were their chiefs and their clans.", "description": "The sentence expresses a “never” meaning; caa still appears before the verb area to carry negation."}, {"target_sentence": "-Ödru ua? adree caa hnyi löng ûthumetu?", "source_sentence": "- Where are they?
