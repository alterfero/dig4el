Intransitive sentences show a close split between EA (8 instances) and AE (5 instances). The language demonstrates flexibility in word order, with EAP used across various sentence types including questions, assertions, and orders, in both wildcard and non-wildcard contexts. AEP appears in specific constructions like questions, assertions, and deontic expressions. Notably, patient-initial orders (PAE, PEA) and APE are absent. This pattern suggests a language with a default event-initial structure, but with the capacity to use agent-initial orders for particular semantic or pragmatic purposes.
