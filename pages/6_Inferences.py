The single instances of EAP and EA orders suggest highly specialized uses.

For transitive sentences, EAP is the most common order (8 instances), followed by AEP (4 instances), with a single occurrence of EPA. Intransitive sentences show a close split between EA (8 instances) and AE (5 instances). The language demonstrates flexibility in word order, with EAP used across various sentence types including questions, assertions, and orders, in both wildcard and non-wildcard contexts. AEP appears in specific constructions like questions, assertions, and deontic expressions. Notably, patient-initial orders (PAE, PEA) and APE are absent. This pattern suggests a language with a default event-initial structure, but with the capacity to use agent-initial orders for particular semantic or pragmatic purposes. The distribution of wildcard markings doesn't show a clear pattern, indicating that word order flexibility might not be strongly tied to specific construction types.")

It's like saying 'Running is the dog' instead of 'The dog is running.' They do this a lot, especially when they're talking about someone doing something to something else. Sometimes they start with who's doing the action, but not as often. They can mix up the order of words to mean different things, like asking questions or giving orders. It's kind of like a puzzle where you can move the pieces around, but some ways of putting the pieces together are used more than others. The cool thing is, they never start a sentence with the thing that's being acted on - it's always the action or the person doing it first.")
