# Digital Inferential Grammar for Endangered Languages
[![License: AGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPL_v3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0)

DIG4EL is a research prototype software designed to produce grammatical descriptions of endangered languages through automated observations and inferences. 
Observations are derived from Conversational Questionnaires, as well as prior data and probabilities from Grambank and WALS 
from the Max Planck Institute. DIG4EL implements a method that is being developed as part the doctoral research of Sebastien CHRISTIAN 
at the University of French Polynesia, expected to be completed in late 2026. An official public release of the software is anticipated around that time. 
Until then, this software is available primarily for testing and review purposes and will sustain major changes as the method evolves and
feddback is received.
